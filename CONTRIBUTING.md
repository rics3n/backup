# Contributing to Backup

Thank you for contributing to Backup!

## Bugs

To report a bug, use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/backup/backup/issues). Please check the Open issues, and create a new issue if you do not see a report that matches the bug that you have found.

Backup is used with many different systems and configurations, so the first step for us to solve a problem is knowing how to reproduce it. You can help us solve your issue by including the versions of Ruby,
Backup and the operating system on the computer that you used.

To submit a bug fix, please [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/backup/backup/compare). Always develop changes against the
`master` branch. Read the Pull Requests section below for more help with
preparing fixes.

## New Features

We are happy to discuss requests for specific features. Please check [the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/backup/backup) to
see if the feature has already been requested, and create a new Issue if there
is not already an issue that describes the feature that you need. A good feature
request will clearly explain the feature that is required, and include a use
case.

Of course, if you would like to write an implementation, that is even better! To
submit a feature, please [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/backup/backup/compare). Always develop changes against the
`master` branch. Read the Pull Requests section below for more help with
developing features in this project.

## Asking for (or Giving) Help

If you would like to talk about either using Backup or writing code for it,
please leave a message in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/backup/backup).
Maintainers are not online at all times, but we will reply to any questions that you ask there.

## Pull Requests

We use the standard GitHub [Pull Requests feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). If you would like to discuss some details before you start working on a feature or bug fix, [open an issue](https://github.com/backup/backup/issues).

To help us review your code:

* Use the latest version of the `master` branch as the base for your topic branch
* Be sure to use the latest version of Ruby 2 when you write and test your code
* In the comment box for your pull request, specify the operating system(s) and Ruby version that you have tested your code on
* Write [clear commit
messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
the first line should be 50 characters or less, and be a clear summary of the commit, e.g. "Fix Nokogiri compile issue on macOS Sierra, GH #305".

## Triage Issues [![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/backup/backup/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/backup/backup)

In addition to contributing code, you can help to triage issues. This can include reproducing bug reports or asking for vital information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to backup on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/backup/backup).
